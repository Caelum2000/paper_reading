1. "Weak OT formulation" $\rightarrow$ dual problem $\rightarrow$ "noise outsourcing" $\rightarrow$ the form could use NN and Monte-Carlo estimator
2. how to define cost C in Weak OT? This work provided a form could apply Monte-Carlo estimator
3. mathematical details need to check:
   1. how to derive dual problem ?
   2. proof of Lemma 3.   This lemma integrates push forward operator T. T is used to style transfer in generative model
