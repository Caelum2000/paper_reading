## Theoretical Study on the Relationship between the Hamming Distance and the Convergence of Hopfield Neural Networks

### Summary
This paper proposes a modified binary hopfield network update rule. Specifically, when the weighted input to a node in the HNN is 0, the node's state is preserved rather than being set to a constant value for the next state. Under this modified rule, the author explains the convergence behavior of the HNN when memorizing one or two patterns, as well as its relationship with the Hamming distance.

### Strengths (optional)
Certain modifications have been made to the update rules commonly used in HNN, which may be inspiring for HNN research.
### Weaknesses
1. The author did not prove well why the modified rules Eq.6 are better than the original ones Eq.3 Eq.4, but only analyzed the situation of the modified rules in memorizing patterns. 
2. The author only analyzed two simple input cases, without generalizing to a wider range of cases. For example, when memorizing M patterns, what are the common behaviors or how to analyze the memory capacity of the modified HNN?

### Justify your score
The paper proposes modifications to the update rule of the HNN, offering a new research perspective. However, the drawbacks are also evident, such as the fact that the approach is not generalized to arbitrary cases and is only "proven" (or more precisely, computed) for specific forms of input patterns. Additionally, the authors do not explain why the update rule need to be modified or what advantages it offers over the traditional rule. If the authors can address the issues mentioned in the weaknesses, I would be willing to increase my score.
