# Title: Optimizing Language Model Embeddings to Voxel Activity Improves Brain Activity Predictions

# Review

## Strengths
1. This paper introduces a novel voxel-specific optimization approach, addressing a gap in prior studies that relied on uniform embeddings, thereby offering a more nuanced understanding of contextual semantic processing across the brain
2. Methodology is rigorous, employing well-established techniques such as banded ridge regression for model fitting and cross-validation for parameter tuning, while incorporating controls like lexical baselines and multiple stimulus conditions to ensure robustness.
3. Empirical results are clearly presented through quantitative metrics, visualizations (e.g., performance histograms and cortical maps), and statistical analyses, facilitating interpretation and replication. Additionally, the work extends to two language models (BERT and GPT-2), enhancing generalizability, and includes appendices for supplementary details, promoting transparency.

## Weaknesses
The primary weakness of this article lies in the insufficiently detailed description of background knowledge and experimental details. It is recommended to elaborate on the background knowledge, for example, specifying the tasks for which embeddings are used, among others; this would assist readers with a machine learning background in better understanding the paper. It is also suggested to employ more mathematical language rather than textual descriptions for the experimental process and the methods section.

## Minor issuses
1. It is recommended to expand Figure 1, as the current Figure 1 does not clearly articulate the differences and contributions of the methods.
2. The quotation marks in the article may have been used incorrectly due to LaTeX syntax errors; please review and revise the quotation marks accordingly.

## Question
How does this work "optimize" the embedding length or the number of model layers? Is it through simple enumeration? Did the authors employ meta-learning, reinforcement learning, or heuristic algorithms (such as genetic algorithms) for optimization these hyperparameters?
