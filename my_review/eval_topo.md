### Summary
This paper proposes a method for evaluating the topological fitness of human brain-inspired echo state networks (ESNs) by embedding structural connectomes (SC) and functional connectomes (FC) to explore the impact of different functional sub-circuits (derived from fMRI) on ESN performance in processing and memory tasks. Experimental results indicate that ESN performance is highly dependent on the neurophysiological characteristics of specific functional sub-circuits for various tasks. 

### Soundness
3: good

### Presentation
3: good

### Contribution
2: fair

### Strength
The article verifies through a series of experiments that the topology of different sub-circuits may affect the performance of the network from an experimental perspective.

### Weakness
The contribution of this article appears limited, as the study neither introduces a series of new methods nor offers insights into the experimental results. It merely alters the network structure, observes phenomena, and draws conclusions. Since this work falls within the field of computational neuroscience, I believe it is important to provide some theoretical explanations for the experimental results.

### Questio
I recommend that the authors provide theoretical and mathematical analysis to support the results obtained from their computational model.

### Rating
5: below threshold

### Confidence
2: Willing to defend
