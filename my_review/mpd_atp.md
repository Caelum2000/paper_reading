## Review of "Membrane Potential-Driven Adaptive Threshold Plasticity for Robust SNNs: A Bio-inspired Mechanism Combining Inverse Depolarization Rate and Proportional Membrane Potential Dynamic"

### Confidential Comments to the Editor
The manuscript introduces Membrane Potential-Driven Adaptive Threshold Plasticity (MPD-ATP), a novel adaptive threshold mechanism for spiking neural networks (SNNs), inspired by neuroscientific observations (as cited in references [33] and [34]). The proposed model effectively validates the applicability of these biological mechanisms to SNNs, demonstrating promising performance. The manuscript is well-written and logically structured. I recommend acceptance, provided the concerns outlined in the "Comments to the Author" section are adequately addressed.

### Comments to the Author

1. The experimental results demonstrate that MPD-ATP outperforms other SNN-based networks. However, the introduction of additional computational steps in MPD-ATP warrants a comparison of computational resources, such as floating-point operations (FLOPs) and parameter counts. I recommend include this analysis to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the method's efficiency.

2. In the "Noise Robustness Performance Evaluation" section, the manuscript reports MPD-ATP's noise-agnostic behavior, which is a compelling finding. Could the authors provide a more intuitive explanation of why MPD-ATP exhibits enhanced noise resilience? This would strengthen the manuscript's interpretability and appeal to a broader audience.
