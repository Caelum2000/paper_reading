1. Analyze the commonality in variant diffusion objectives (including DDPM, VDM etc.)
2. point that all objectives can be seen as VDM objective multiplies a weighting function (Eq.5)
3. could use importance sampling rewriting Eq.5
4. Theorem 1: when weighting function is monotonic, Eq.5 is equivalent to ELBO of data augmentation
